            <p>The Flame Calculator provides insight into six possible relationship categories:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Friends:</b> This indicates that your connection might be rooted in a deep, trustworthy friendship. It suggests mutual respect, shared interests, and companionship.</li>
                <li><b>Lovers: </b>This result points toward romantic possibilities. It hints at an emotional or physical attraction between the two people, indicating the potential for a passionate relationship.</li>
                <li><b>Affectionate: </b>An affectionate relationship signifies a deep emotional bond. You may not be lovers, but there’s a sense of care, warmth, and emotional support between you.</li>
                <li><b>Marriage: </b>This signifies a strong and lasting connection that could lead to a lifelong partnership. It’s often seen as the most desirable result for those seeking a stable, committed relationship.</li>
                <li><b>Enemies: </b>While it may sound negative, this result suggests friction or conflict in your dynamic. However, many great relationships also start with rivalry, so it could mean you’re learning to overcome differences!</li>
                <li><b>Siblings: </b>A sibling relationship is built on a foundation of shared memories, mutual understanding, and unconditional support. Though you may have your differences, there’s a deep connection rooted in love and loyalty that stands the test of time.</li>
